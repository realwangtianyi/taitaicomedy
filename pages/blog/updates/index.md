- I recently gave a talk at the Big Data Analytics, Discovery and Visualization [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Analytics-Discovery-Visualization/events/165561732/) entitled "Big Data Introduction to D3." Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFCDA1uzGFo) and [slides](http://slid.es/samselikoff/big-data-intro-to-d3-jan-2014).

- You can find a new tutorial which closely follows the talk [here](/tutorials/intro-to-d3.html).

- I'll be speaking at [OpenVis Conference](http://openvisconf.com/) about using D3 with Backbone, Angular and Ember. The conference is taking place in Boston, MA from April 24-25th.

- I recently took a new position as a front-end developer at [Cantina Consulting](http://cantina.co/) - and am loving every minute of it!
