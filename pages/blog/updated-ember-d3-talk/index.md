Last night I gave an updated version of my _Ember and D3: Building a Simple Dashboard_ talk at the [Boston D3.js](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-d3-js-User-Group/) meetup group. The biggest changes are the use of components instead of views, and the upgrade to Ember 1.0.0.  
Here are the materials from my presentation.
